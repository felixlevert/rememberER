******APP init******
    Populate project list by looping through DB and calling project list function
    Create (hidden) project elements from DB // do this when clicking on projects? what is better?
    Instantiate button DOM class





******CONNECTING THE MODALS TO THE PLUS BUTTONS THROUGH THE DOM*****
    Button handler class
    adds event listeners to buttons, define functions that reveal modals.
    
    build just one function that takes a type argument and reveals the right modal through a string literal variable in the ID.
    gets instantiated by init function looping through all buttons?




*****DATABASE*****
    Temporarily just array of objects in a separate file.
    Use local storage at first?
    Each project has ID, title, description and array of TASK objects.


****PROJECT LIST class/funct/whatevs*****
    Populates project list in left navbar
    attach click listeners to each project, reveals DOM element defined in project class?
    Drag and drop to reorder items?


*****PROJECT CLASS*****
    --- Function that creates the DOM elements for the main part of screen
            Default for when no tasks yet, screen telling you to add some.
            Grabs all tasks from DB, use task class for DOM elements, add them all to page.
            

    DONE function that marks the task as done. (separate section on page? Move to bottom with checkmark/diff color?)

    DELETE function that removes the task completely.
        Design idea: little trash can icon / STOP icon greyed out on main task line, when click pushes element sideways reveals red DELETE button underneath.

**** TASK CLASS *****
    creates DOM element for each task, with revealable description
    Just title + due date at first, click on it reveals description 
                in drop down box, pushes other items down. (Add more things to tasks eventually)
